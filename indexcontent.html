  <H3>Week 10 Hardware (Monday Jan. 8)</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>
	<li>Updated Progress Report. Can be found below</li>
	<li>Presented the LCD working as intended and code written over the break. Encountered an issue in class where the Pi would not accept inputs
	   from the Pi, the issue has since been resolved</li>
	   <ul>At first it appeared to be a driver issue but after further testing throughout the week it turns out that it was an issue
		   with how Remote Desktop Connection ran. When the Python script was being run it was as if it were on a separate terminal,
		   which is why the Pi acts as if it were unable to receive the inputs from the numpad. Connecting a keyboard and a monitor
		   directly to the Pi and running the script from that terminal window fixes this. To alleviate this issue in the future, 
		   I will set it up so that the script runs on startup and put in a condition in the script that causes it to terminate 
		   the program if necessary.
	   </ul>
	   <ul>Budget hasn't been affected. No new devices had to be purchased and no old components needed to be replaced</ul>
	   <ul>As it stands, progress is coming along nicely for the presentation. Will just need to prepare a presentation (possibly 
		   PowerPoint) to show for next week. Also currently working on designing a PCB on fritzing to avoid a 
		   mess of wires. Considering on designing a case as well to house the LCD as the one I have won't fit snuggly in the
		   current case. But if there isn't enough time for that I'll leave that to next semester.</ul>

  <H3>Holiday Break (Dec. 23 to Jan. 7)</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>
	<li>Wrote Python script that displays information such as time/date, prompts the user to input PIN and the status of 
	   other devices in the proposed System. As the database is still not fully set up the variables were instead assigned
	   test values to check if the statements worked.</li>
